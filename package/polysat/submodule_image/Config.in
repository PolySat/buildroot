config BR2_PACKAGE_SUBMODULE_IMAGE
	bool "Create image using files from buildroot's parent"
	help
            Select this option when using buildroot as a git submodule
             underneath a repo that contains custom files for your FSW image.
             This option specifically looks in ../rootfs for additional
             files to include in the build.
